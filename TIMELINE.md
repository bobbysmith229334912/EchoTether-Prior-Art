# EchoTether — Concept Timeline

This timeline documents the evolution of the EchoTether concept and exists to establish chronology and authorship.

---

## Early Concept Formation
- Initial idea for a geo-social system centered on location-bound digital traces (“whispers”) tied to real-world places.
- Focus on human presence, memory, and discovery rather than algorithmic feeds.

## Core Concept Definition
- Defined the concept of location-bound whispers discoverable only within a physical proximity.
- Introduced privacy-first visibility controls and safety-aware interaction rules.
- Considered optional AR/spatial presentation as a UI layer (conceptual only).

## Scope Expansion
- Identified use cases including events, cities, community memory, and safety-first interactions.
- Defined non-technical value concepts (drops, unlocks, rewards) without implementation disclosure.

## Defensive Publication
- Publicly documented the EchoTether concept to establish prior art.
- Intentionally excluded source code, system architecture, algorithms, and monetization mechanics.
- Applied a non-commercial, no-derivatives license to prevent unauthorized reuse.

## Ongoing Development (Private)
- Implementation, optimization, and commercialization details are maintained privately and are not disclosed in this repository.
- This repository reflects concept documentation only, not execution.
