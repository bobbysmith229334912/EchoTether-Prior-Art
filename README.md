Public prior art + concept documentation for EchoTether (no source code)
# EchoTether — Prior Art

EchoTether is a geo-social concept that lets people leave location-bound digital traces (“whispers”) in real-world spaces, with optional AR/spatial presentation and privacy-first controls.

This repository exists to document the original EchoTether concept and establish public prior art.  
It intentionally contains **no application source code**.

## High-level idea
- Location-bound “whispers” users can discover in the real world
- Privacy controls and safety-first moderation approach
- Optional AR/spatial UI layer (presentation detail intentionally high-level)
- Value layer / monetization concept (details intentionally non-implementation)

## What’s in this repo
- Concept description (non-technical)
- Use cases and product scope
- Terminology and definitions
