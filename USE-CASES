# EchoTether — Use Cases

## 1) Events & meetups
People leave whispers at venues (concerts, conventions, pop-ups) so attendees discover them on arrival.

## 2) City discovery
Local “hidden gems” are left as whispers that appear when someone is near, encouraging real exploration.

## 3) Community memory
Neighborhood stories and shared moments exist as location-bound posts that feel like “the place remembers.”

## 4) Safety-first location interactions
Reporting, blocking, and visibility rules are designed specifically for real-world situations.

## 5) Value drops (optional)
Users can attach optional rewards/drops/unlocks to whispers to drive engagement without requiring public disclosure of implementation.
